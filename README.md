# WisePops Frontend Test

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Basics

WisePops is on a mission to provide marketers with the best tool to create popups.

In this exercise, we'll test your React skill by creating a simple WisePops clone.

The project is already setup in this repository so to start, fork it and when
you are done invite @clmnt-wisepops to collaborate on it.

## Steps

For each step that follows you will have to edit some files already provided,
but doesn't hesitate to go further. Also, it will be great if you split your
steps using branches or commits.

``` sh
# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start API & Dev server
yarn start
```

### 1. Show a static campaign on `/demo` page
